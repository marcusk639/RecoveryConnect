Additional Group Features to Implement

Figure out group navigation logic

1. Group Activity Feed
   We should create a central place where members can see all group activity in chronological order, including:

New announcements
Upcoming meetings
Member celebrations
Recent treasury updates
New members joining

This would serve as the "home" screen when a user enters a group, providing an at-a-glance overview of what's happening. 2. Enhanced Meeting Management
Beyond the basic meeting details we've implemented, let's add:

Recurring meeting settings
Meeting reminders with notifications
Attendance tracking (optional)
Service position rotation for meetings
Meeting format details and notes

3. Group Resource Library
   A place for groups to store and share resources:

Meeting formats
Common readings
Group conscience decisions
Service commitment descriptions
Fellowship literature references

4. Business Meeting Tools
   Specialized tools for conducting business meetings:

Agenda creation and management
Motion tracking
Voting functionality
Minutes recording and distribution
Treasury reporting integration

5. Group Settings and Customization
   Allow groups to customize their experience:

Group avatar/image
Customizable roles and positions
Group preferences (e.g., anonymity level, celebration preferences)
Group privacy settings (open, closed, or invisible)

6. Enhanced Communication Tools
   Beyond the simple announcement system we've started with:

Topic-based discussion threads
Direct messaging between members
Group chat for informal communication
Service commitment communications

7. Integration with Existing Recovery Resources
   Connect with existing recovery ecosystem:

Integration with official meeting directories
Links to fellowship literature and resources
Connections to area and regional service structures
Support for common recovery technology standards

Implementation Strategy
I recommend we implement these features in the following order:

Group Activity Feed - This provides immediate value and ties together existing functionality
Enhanced Meeting Management - Core to the app's purpose and daily usage
Group Resource Library - Relatively simple to implement but high value
Enhanced Communication Tools - Builds community and engagement
Group Settings - Allows customization once basic functionality is solid
Business Meeting Tools - More complex but high value for group operations
External Integrations - Can be added progressively as the app matures

Would you like me to start implementing any of these specific features? I can begin with designing and implementing the Group Activity Feed as it would provide immediate value to users.
