Additional Group Features to Implement

Figure out group navigation logic

1. Group Activity Feed
   We should create a central place where members can see all group activity in chronological order, including:

New announcements
Upcoming meetings
Member celebrations
Recent treasury updates
New members joining

This would serve as the "home" screen when a user enters a group, providing an at-a-glance overview of what's happening. 2. Enhanced Meeting Management
Beyond the basic meeting details we've implemented, let's add:

Recurring meeting settings
Meeting reminders with notifications
Attendance tracking (optional)
Service position rotation for meetings
Meeting format details and notes

3. Group Resource Library
   A place for groups to store and share resources:

Meeting formats
Common readings
Group conscience decisions
Service commitment descriptions
Fellowship literature references

4. Business Meeting Tools
   Specialized tools for conducting business meetings:

Agenda creation and management
Motion tracking
Voting functionality
Minutes recording and distribution
Treasury reporting integration

5. Group Settings and Customization
   Allow groups to customize their experience:

Group avatar/image
Customizable roles and positions
Group preferences (e.g., anonymity level, celebration preferences)
Group privacy settings (open, closed, or invisible)

6. Enhanced Communication Tools
   Beyond the simple announcement system we've started with:

Topic-based discussion threads
Direct messaging between members
Group chat for informal communication
Service commitment communications

7. Integration with Existing Recovery Resources
   Connect with existing recovery ecosystem:

Integration with official meeting directories
Links to fellowship literature and resources
Connections to area and regional service structures
Support for common recovery technology standards

Implementation Strategy
I recommend we implement these features in the following order:

Group Activity Feed - This provides immediate value and ties together existing functionality
Enhanced Meeting Management - Core to the app's purpose and daily usage
Group Resource Library - Relatively simple to implement but high value
Enhanced Communication Tools - Builds community and engagement
Group Settings - Allows customization once basic functionality is solid
Business Meeting Tools - More complex but high value for group operations
External Integrations - Can be added progressively as the app matures

Would you like me to start implementing any of these specific features? I can begin with designing and implementing the Group Activity Feed as it would provide immediate value to users.

Notifications:

Okay, let's brainstorm some notification types for Homegroups, focusing on _meaningful engagement_ rather than just noise. The goal is to bring users back to the app for valuable reasons related to their recovery journey and group participation, always respecting privacy.

Here are notification ideas categorized for clarity:

**I. Personal Recovery & Engagement:**

1.  **Sobriety Milestone Reached:**

    - **Trigger:** User reaches a significant milestone (24hrs, 30/60/90 days, 6 months, 1 year, etc.) based on their set sobriety date.
    - **Content:** "Congratulations on reaching [Milestone Label]! Keep up the great work." or "ðŸŽ‰ You've reached [Milestone Label]! Celebrate your progress."
    - **Engagement:** Positive reinforcement, encourages opening the app to see the tracker/medallion.
    - **Control:** User opt-in via Profile/Sobriety Settings.

2.  **Daily Check-in / Reflection Prompt (Optional & Customizable):**

    - **Trigger:** Scheduled daily notification (user sets time).
    - **Content:** "Checking in: How are you feeling today?" or "A moment for gratitude: What are you thankful for in your recovery today?" or a rotating daily quote/reading snippet.
    - **Engagement:** Creates a daily ritual, encourages mindfulness and interaction with potential journaling features (if added later).
    - **Control:** User opt-in, user sets time, user might choose prompt type.

3.  **Meeting Reminders:**
    - **Trigger:** A meeting saved to the user's personal schedule is approaching (e.g., 1 hour before).
    - **Content:** "Meeting Reminder: '[Meeting Name]' starts soon at [Time]."
    - **Engagement:** Practical utility, helps users attend meetings they planned for, reinforces schedule feature use.
    - **Control:** User opt-in per meeting saved or globally in notification settings.

**II. Homegroup Connectivity & Community:**

4.  **New Group Announcement:**

    - **Trigger:** An admin posts a new announcement in one of the user's homegroups.
    - **Content:** "'[Group Name]' posted a new announcement." (Keep content private for lock screen).
    - **Engagement:** Keeps members informed about essential group news (meeting changes, events, etc.).
    - **Control:** Global toggle for "Group Announcements" in settings.

5.  **Group Chat Mentions:**

    - **Trigger:** User is specifically @mentioned in a group chat.
    - **Content:** "[User Name] mentioned you in '[Group Name] Chat'."
    - **Engagement:** Draws attention to direct communication, encourages participation.
    - **Control:** Toggle for "Chat Mentions".

6.  **Group Chat Activity Summary (Optional & Batched):**

    - **Trigger:** Significant unread activity in a group chat (e.g., 5+ new messages since last visit, batched, maybe max 1-2 per day per group).
    - **Content:** "New messages in '[Group Name] Chat'."
    - **Engagement:** Informs users of ongoing conversation without being overwhelming. Needs careful tuning to avoid annoyance.
    - **Control:** Toggle for "Chat Activity Summaries" (off by default might be wise).

7.  **Upcoming Group Celebration/Anniversary:**
    - **Trigger:** A member's sobriety anniversary (that they've opted to share within the group) is approaching (e.g., 1 day before).
    - **Content:** "'[Member Display Name]'s anniversary is tomorrow in '[Group Name]'!"
    - **Engagement:** Fosters community support and celebration within the group context.
    - **Control:** Requires _both_ the member to opt-in to sharing _and_ other members to opt-in to receiving these celebration notifications.

**III. Group Admin / Service Roles (Targeted):**

8.  **Pending Admin Request (For Super Admins):**

    - **Trigger:** A new admin request is submitted for _any_ group.
    - **Content:** "New admin request submitted for '[Group Name]'."
    - **Engagement:** Prompts super admins to review and manage requests promptly via the Admin Panel.
    - **Control:** Role-based (likely non-optional for super admins).

9.  **Admin Request Approved/Denied (For Requesting User):**

    - **Trigger:** A super admin approves or denies the user's request.
    - **Content:** "Your admin request for '[Group Name]' has been approved!" or "...was not approved."
    - **Engagement:** Informs the user of the outcome.
    - **Control:** Likely non-optional for the user who made the request.

10. **Treasury Reminders (For Treasurers - Future):**
    - **Trigger:** Approaching date for needing to provide a treasury report (if this logic is built).
    - **Content:** "Reminder: Prepare the treasury report for '[Group Name]'s upcoming business meeting."
    - **Engagement:** Helps treasurers fulfill their service commitment.
    - **Control:** Role-based.

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** Use FCM to send notifications efficiently.
- **Granular Control:** Provide clear settings for users to toggle _each category_ of notification on/off. Default important ones (announcements, mentions) to 'on' but allow opt-out. Default optional ones (daily check-in, chat summary) to 'off'.
- **Privacy:** Never show sensitive message content or personal details directly in the notification payload visible on the lock screen.
- **Backend Triggering:** Most notifications (milestones, announcements, chat, admin actions) will need to be triggered by backend logic (Cloud Functions) based on database events or scheduled tasks.
- **Rate Limiting/Batching:** Be mindful of notification frequency, especially for chat summaries.

By implementing a thoughtful selection of these, focusing on user control and clear value, you can significantly enhance engagement without overwhelming users.
