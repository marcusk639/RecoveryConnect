## Priority Features

Of all these features, I would recommend prioritizing these for the initial MVP:

1. **Authentication & User Management**: This is foundational
2. **Meeting Search & Favoriting**: Core utility for most users
3. **Group Communication**: The announcement system is a key differentiator
4. **Basic Treasury Management**: Addresses a major pain point for groups
5. **Offline Meeting Access**: Critical for actual meeting attendance

These core features would deliver on the main value propositions of the app while keeping the scope manageable for an MVP release. Once validated with users, the remaining features could be prioritized based on feedback.
