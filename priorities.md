Okay, focusing specifically on features that drive **group adoption and long-term retention** (as opposed to just individual user engagement), here's a prioritized list based on the core needs and pain points of 12-step homegroups:

**Tier 1: Must-Haves for Group Adoption (Solve Core Problems)**

1.  **Flawless & Simple Meeting Management (Admin Focus):**

    - **Why:** The primary function of a homegroup is the meeting. If managing this isn't seamless _for the secretary/admin_, the group won't use the app.
    - **Features:**
      - **Intuitive Editing:** Extremely simple interface for admins to update meeting time, location (physical & online link), format(s), and add temporary notices (e.g., "Meeting cancelled this week", "Speaker meeting tonight").
      - **Recurring & Exception Handling:** Clear way to set recurring schedules and easily mark exceptions/cancellations.
      - **Clear Display for Members:** Accurate, easy-to-read meeting details for members.

2.  **Reliable & Focused Group Announcements:**

    - **Why:** Replaces inefficient phone trees, noisy group texts, or emails. This is often a major pain point for disseminating official group business.
    - **Features:**
      - **Admin Posting:** Only designated admins can post official announcements.
      - **Clear Feed:** A dedicated, uncluttered section showing only official announcements chronologically.
      - **Push Notifications (Reliable):** Opt-in notifications for members when a new announcement is posted (as planned).
      - **Read Receipts (Optional/Simple):** Maybe just for admins to see _how many_ have seen it, not _who_.

3.  **Simplified & Transparent Treasury Management:**

    - **Why:** This is arguably the biggest operational headache for many groups and a huge value proposition. Fear of mismanagement or complexity during treasurer rotation is common.
    - **Features:**
      - **Dead-Simple Input:** Easy entry for 7th Tradition contributions (cash/digital totals, not individual tracking) and group expenses (rent, literature, coffee). Predefined common categories.
      - **Clear Balance & Reserve:** Prominent display of current balance and prudent reserve.
      - **Basic Reporting:** Generate a simple, printable/shareable report for the business meeting (Income, Expenses, Starting/Ending Balance for the month).
      - **Effortless Treasurer Handoff:** A secure mechanism to transfer treasurer role/access within the app, preserving historical data. _(This alone is a killer feature)_.

4.  **Privacy-Centric Member Directory (Optional Fields):**
    - **Why:** Groups need contact info sometimes, but privacy/anonymity is paramount. Replacing physical lists or insecure group texts is valuable.
    - **Features:**
      - **Admin Managed:** Admins add/remove members (or members join via invite).
      - **Minimal Required Info:** Only Display Name (First Name/Initial enforced by app setting).
      - **Optional, Controlled Sharing:** Members explicitly choose whether to share phone/email _within that specific group_. Default to hidden.
      - **Role Display:** Clearly show who holds service positions (Admin, Treasurer, Secretary, GSR, etc.).

**Tier 2: High-Impact Features for Retention & Utility**

5.  **Service Position Tracking & Rotation:**

    - **Why:** Helps groups manage commitments and ensures positions don't fall through the cracks.
    - **Features:**
      - List defined service positions (Secretary, Treasurer, Greeter, Coffee Maker, GSR, etc.).
      - Assign members to positions with start/end dates (based on group commitment length).
      - Optional reminders for admins/members when a position term is ending.
      - Display "Open Positions".

6.  **Basic Business Meeting Support:**

    - **Why:** Formalizes group conscience and decision-making.
    - **Features:**
      - Simple scheduling of business meetings (visible on group calendar/feed).
      - Ability to link a generated Treasury Report to a meeting record.
      - (Future: Agenda items, minutes notes).

7.  **Group Calendar/Activity Feed:**
    - **Why:** Centralizes information, reducing the need for members to hunt.
    - **Features:**
      - A feed showing upcoming regular meetings, scheduled business meetings, group events/anniversaries (opt-in), and links to recent announcements.

**Tier 3: Nice-to-Haves / Individual Engagement within Group Context**

8.  **Group Chat (Carefully Implemented):**

    - **Why:** Can foster fellowship but also risks noise/controversy if not managed.
    - **Features:**
      - Clear separation from Announcements.
      - Admin ability to mute/remove disruptive users _from the chat_.
      - Mention notifications (as discussed).
      - _Consider making it optional per group._

9.  **Sobriety Milestone Celebrations (Group Opt-In):**
    - **Why:** Fosters community support.
    - **Features:**
      - Members opt-in to sharing their sobriety date _with the group_.
      - Automated (opt-in) notification/post in the group feed/calendar for upcoming anniversaries.

**Key Principles for Adoption/Retention:**

- **Simplicity:** Admins are volunteers. Tools must be intuitive and require minimal effort.
- **Reliability:** Meeting info and announcements _must_ be accurate and delivered reliably.
- **Privacy First:** Every feature must be designed with anonymity as the default.
- **Solve Real Problems:** Focus on fixing the actual operational headaches groups face (Treasury, Communication, Scheduling).
- **Low Barrier to Entry:** Easy onboarding for both individuals and the group as a whole (invites are key).

Focusing intensely on **Tier 1 features** and making them exceptionally user-friendly and reliable is the surest path to getting homegroups to adopt and _keep_ using Recovery Connect.
